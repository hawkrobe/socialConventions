social_conventions
==================

This repository contains data and analysis code for our paper "The formation of social conventions in real-time environments". `analysis.py` is the script underlying an iPython notebook environment and contains all non-code cells as comments. 

Unfortunately, Github does not handle iPython notebook files very elegantly, so the best way to view the code from the analysis, along with output at each step, is by downloading `analysis.html` and opening it in a browser. This will not allow for interactivity, but preserves the analysis in the form it was used in the paper.
